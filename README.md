# README for CIS-545 Big Data Analysis Project - Food.com Review Analysis

## Introduction
This repository hosts our project for the University of Pennsylvania's CIS-545 Big Data Analysis class. It features a detailed analysis of food reviews and recipes from Food.com, showcased in an IPython Notebook.

## Project Overview
Our analysis aims to leverage the Food.com dataset to aid in informed decision-making about food and recipes. We employ Machine Learning models to predict nutritional content, classify recipes by cooking time, and categorize them for ease of search. The project also delves into sentiment analysis of reviews and trends in food preferences.
